At the moment I am in the proccess of finishing my udemy web development course, while also being halfway done with a game development course from XAMK.
Here and there I am preparing to start a course from pirple on C# and I am also halfway finished with a course on professional graphic design.
I have finished my M3DS course and earned my 3D Printer, and I have so many more courses downloaded ready to watch.
